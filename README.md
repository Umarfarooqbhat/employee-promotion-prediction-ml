# üß† Employee Promotion Prediction (ML Project)

This project aims to predict which employees are most likely to be promoted based on their past performance, training scores, and key HR metrics. The goal is to help HR teams make data-driven, fair, and efficient promotion decisions.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Domain**: Human Resources / HR Analytics
- **Objective**: Build a machine learning model to classify employees into "Promoted" or "Not Promoted"
- **Dataset Size**: 23,490 records
- **Target Variable**: `is_promoted`

## üß™ Techniques Used

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
- Feature Scaling with:
  - StandardScaler
  - MinMaxScaler
  - RobustScaler
  - MaxAbsScaler
- ML Models:
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - CatBoost
- Model Evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - ROC-AUC
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report

## ‚úÖ Final Model

After comparison, **CatBoost** was chosen as the final model due to its:
- Highest accuracy of **74.40%**
- Strong ROC-AUC score of **0.748**
- Consistency across scalers
- Native handling of categorical features

## üìà Key Insights

- **KPI Met** and **Average Training Score** are top predictors of promotion
- Employees with previous high ratings are more likely to be promoted
- KPI achievement is statistically significant (p-value < 0.05) in predicting performance

## üìä Visuals

- Model Accuracy Comparison
- ROC-AUC Comparison
- Feature Importance (CatBoost)

## üéØ Business Impact

This model enables HR teams to:
- Proactively identify promotable employees
- Reduce manual bias in decisions
- Increase fairness and employee satisfaction
- Improve talent retention
